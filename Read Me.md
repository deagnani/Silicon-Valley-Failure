# Analysis of the Silicon Valley Bank Failure

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failure. Utilizing data from various sources compiled into CSV files and analysis through Jupyter Notebooks, this project aims to uncover patterns and insights related to the bank's collapse.

## Repository Structure
Below is the structure of the repository and a brief description of its contents:

### Data
This folder contains six CSV files with data relevant to the SVB failure. The specific contents and sources of these CSV files will be renamed and detailed by the repository maintainer.

### Notebooks
- `webscrappingprojekt1.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code used for scraping the web to gather data about the SVB failure. It includes details on the scraping strategy, sources, and data extraction methods.
  
- `dataanalysisprojekt1.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook performs a detailed analysis of the collected data. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and various statistical analyses to understand the factors leading to the bank's failure.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to replicate the analysis or to explore the data further.
